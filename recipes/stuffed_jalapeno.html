        <p>Like part of the title for recipe stuffed is how i feel after these cause i tend to go for to many</p>
        <p>A word of advice for those who aren't a fan of heat make sure to get all the seeds out of the peppers cause you will notice if you dont</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup(8 ounces) cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup grated pepper jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 shallots, minced</li>
            <li>10 straight, similarly sized jalapenos halved lengthwise and seeded</li>
            <li>20 cocktail sausages</li>
            <li>20 bacon slices(about 2 packs</li>

            <li>Preheat oven to 375F, set a wire rack over a baking sheet</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the cream cheese, pepper jack, spices and minced shallots until well combined</li>
            <li>spread 1 tablespoon of the cheese mixture on each jalapeno slice until it is completely
                covered and top with a mini sausage. Wrap a slice of bacon around the filled jalapeno,
                covering it from end to end so the bacon overlaps slightly. if necessary secure with toothpick.

            <li>Place the jalapenos on the rack in the baking sheet. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until bacon
                is crisp and jalapenos are soft
